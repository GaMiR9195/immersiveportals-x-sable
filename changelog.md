## [Unreleased Changes]

Atlas hardening since the 0.5.0 merge (PR #15):

### Fixed

- Multi-portal straddle: contact clipping is aperture-bounded again — the 0.5.0
  full-plane clip let two sessions' half-spaces swallow a ship, and parts beside a
  free-standing frame lost ground collision.
- Ships whose parent dimension is unloaded (e.g. a nether ship while everyone is in
  the overworld) fell through the world. They now go dormant (native Fixed body,
  zero tick cost) and wake in place when a player loads the area; no chunks are
  force-loaded.
- Ships in different parent dimensions collided when their coordinates overlapped
  (per-body parent-frame check in the native dispatcher).
- Connected ships got stuck on the wrong logical side of a portal: the per-member
  transit gate deadlocked once the first member crossed (gate removed).
- A roped partner no longer teleports through together with the crossing ship.

### Changed

- Rigid assemblies (swivel bearings, fixed couplings — joints locking an angular
  axis) cross portals atomically as one unit.
- Ropes span portals: a crossed ship's rope routes through the aperture and pulls
  the trailing body toward it; the chain follows once both ends cross, and backing
  out unwinds. Ropes overstretched past 1.75× natural length (snagged trailing
  body, cross-dimension splits) break, vanilla-lead-style.

### Known Issues

- Rare missed rope re-unification when both ends cross the same portal within a
  tick (diagnostics in place).
